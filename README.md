##  Problem 1 — Methods Implemented

This project demonstrates three different approaches to solve the same problem:

-  **Loop** — Uses basic iteration to process the result step by step.  
-  **Math** — Applies mathematical formulas for faster and more efficient calculation.  
-  **Recursion** — Implements a recursive approach for a functional and elegant solution.  


##  Problem 2 — Features Implemented

Core features included in the refactored version:

- **State Persistence**  
  Saves the selected token amount in **LocalStorage**, ensuring data is preserved after page reload.  

- **Switch From–To Token**  
  Instantly swaps the position of two chosen tokens and updates the calculated result accordingly.  


##  Problem 3 — Code Review & Refactor

-  A detailed file is attached, listing **issues found in the original code**.  
-  A **refactored version** is provided, improving readability, structure, and maintainability.
